# Email Formatter

This site is just a helper client only TypeScript application to take a blob of text and do a bunch of things to it, such as:

- putting just the emails on the right one on each line
- putting just the first part of the email on the right one on each line (useful for getting user accounts to pop into other applications / account tools)
- sorting of the right side alphabetically
- creating chat URLs for Teams chat **ON EACH PERSON'S OWN TEAMS TENANT** (my favorite use case)

and copying the right side back to your clipboard.
