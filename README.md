# email-formatter

This web app will help you take a block of text containing email addresses and extract just the email addresses, one per line.

From there, you can copy them back to the left side, or perform actions such as:

- creating a URL for a Teams chat
- collapsing them into a single line separated by semicolons or commas or more
- copying the right block back to the left side for more actions
- strip out the domains on the right
- reorder alphabetically
